# Spam detection with streamlit
Web app for spam detection built with streamlit.

## Setup Environment
Before running the code, you must setup the python environment that's specified within the `environment.yml` file. To do so, run the following commands within your terminal:
<ul>
    <li><code>conda env create -f environment.yml</code></li>
    <li><code>conda activate spam_detection_streamlit</code></li>
</ul>
In case you want to remove this environment later on, use the following command:<br>
<code>conda remove --name spam_detection_streamlit --all</code>
